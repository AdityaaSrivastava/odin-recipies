    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Samosa is a popular deep-fried pastry known for its crispy outer layer and savory filling. Originating in South Asia, the samosa has become a beloved snack in many parts of the world. The traditional triangular shape of the samosa is achieved by folding a thin layer of dough around a spiced filling, which is then sealed and fried until golden brown.</p>
